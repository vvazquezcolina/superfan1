# FAVICON PLACEHOLDER
# 
# This is a placeholder for favicon.ico
# The actual favicon.ico file needs to be uploaded manually
#
# To create favicon.ico:
# 1. Go to https://favicon.io/
# 2. Upload your Angular Solutions logo
# 3. Download the generated favicon.ico
# 4. Replace this file with the real favicon.ico
# 5. Delete this .placeholder file
#
# Until then, the site will work but won't show a favicon in the browser tab
