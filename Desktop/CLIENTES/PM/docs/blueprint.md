## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Red (#DB0E18) for buttons and CTAs, drawing attention and creating a sense of urgency.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for backgrounds, providing a neutral and clean foundation.
- Accent color: Purple (#953A68) for highlighted icons, adding a touch of Mayan mystique.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif, for an elegant, fashionable feel; Body font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, for modern readability. A font pairing is best in this design as the body of text is of significant length and calls for clear legibility.
- Ensure a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to both mobile and desktop devices.
- Use Mayan-inspired icons to enhance the cultural and regional identity of the site.
- Implement subtle animations on button hover states to provide interactive feedback.
